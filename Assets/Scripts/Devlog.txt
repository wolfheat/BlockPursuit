DEVLOG FOR Block Pursuit"
Jun 2023

* IDEAS
- Make a box puzzle game for mobile.
- Possible game mode
	* Use set of pieces to cover a marked floor area to complete level
	* Randomized levels played to earn tiles, tiles can unlock main levels?

	* Have a window show earn 10gold free or watch ad get 100gold or random tile, activated behind a button which player can press.
	* After completing level show ad if more than 5min has passed?

4/7		* Levels are now selectable by WASD in levelselect and level starts with Space
		* ESC takes player to start menu from Level Select
		* Goals are now placable at levelcreator and saved to level definition
		* Goal tile should be tile along the paintables
5/7		* Created 15 easy levels 15 medium levels ad 5 hard levels, separated them into different lists
		* Added Tabs to level select, maybe make these tinted when not available and then unlocked by completing a tier	
		* Tiers of levels now work in the level select, playe can change tier with the tabs.
		* TAB now enables/disables the edit mode

		* Have selected tab show more clearly, lower contrast of unselected?
		* Change selected color from dark red to something else?


		* Add "cleared" to level select, locked and unlocked?

		* Make correct level be selected when returning to level select

		* Make a selected level be still selected after pressing unlock, 
			* maybe show separate unlock screen

		TODO:
		* Port to Android build, make input controls for mobile
		* Make sure game scales correctly for different mobile resolutions
		* Implement Ads for gaining coins
		* Have game features unlocked by gold in shop
		* Make Shop Screen
		* Change player to something else than a cube, character etc?

		ADS:
		* Player can watch add ever 5 min to gain gold, but also whenever play the random levels to gain as well.
		* Paid player get free gold every 5 min without watching ad.

		MAYBE:
		* Have timer show on HUD? prob not, to stressy.(maybe have as option to turn on in settings/ unlockable in shop?)
		
		ISSUES:

		// - Content -
		* Have some kind of tutorial?
		* Figure out theme and color scheme that fits the game
		* Currently not possible to turn on spot, should it be possible? Decide.
		* Change Load Screen between scenes to animation or not?
		
		// - Mechanics Stuff -		
		
		// - Data stuff -
		* Clean Up tile definition and way levels are stored when created at runtime
		* Make player progress and settings store between sessions.
		* Make system to store what level player completed and use that to update select level page
		* Make player gain gold and tiles when completing levels, animation for this?
		
		// - UI stuff -
		* Make level select tabs more fancy?
		* Make cleared levels show differently in the level select.
		* Add Start level popup if unlock is needed, show cost, show inventory at the same time? Maybe show this in level select instead. 
			- Selected menu shows up with more info in a info box under the selection grid

		// - LevelCreation Stuff -
		* Create randomized level creation for Bronze,Silver,Gold versions
		* Create all levels for main levels
