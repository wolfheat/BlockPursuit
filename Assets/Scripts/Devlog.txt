DEVLOG FOR Block Pursuit"
Jun 2023

* IDEAS
- Make a box puzzle game for mobile.
- Possible game mode
	* Use set of pieces to cover a marked floor area to complete level
	* Randomized levels played to earn tiles, tiles can unlock main levels?

	* Have a window show earn 10gold free or watch ad get 100gold or random tile, activated behind a button which player can press.
	* After completing level show ad if more than 5min has passed?





14/6	* Starting with simple prototype
		* Square play area
		* Player can roll around the game area and box has different colors on each side
		* Box stops at walls
		* Added colored ribbons to show adjecent colors, dont now if to keep
15/6	* Changes so no ribbons are visible
		* Changed camera to perspective
		* Added a lock and a paintbucket
22/6	* Picking up sections and dropping them now works, will not let you drop on to other tiles
24/6	* Added colored borders to clarify pieces
		* New game idea, cover area?
26/6	* Tested player as solid pink, added start menu and some menu sounds, changed font
27/6	* Fixed so player cant interact outside game area, added a wall		
		* Think I fixed issue where player could pick up piece same frame as starting to move
		* Added separate levels to the game and a complete game screen
30/6	* Updated Level Clear graphics, changed start menu buttons etc
1/7		* Created a Level select screen
		* Added loading and saving system
		* Added player inventory
		* Added tiles definitions as scriptable objects
2/7		* Changes Font and start menu layout
		* Made mashup
		* Tiles can now be placed by shift click, preview is showned when shift is held, shows if placable
		* Tiles rotate by scroll wheel and piece type change by right click
3/7		* Made tile definition work so it can be saved into a scriptable object during runtime and loaded into game as level
4/7		* Levels are now selectable by WASD in levelselect and level starts with Space
		* ESC takes player to start menu from Level Select

		TODO:


		* Make it possible to paint goal tiles in editor / maybe have TAB to switch to edit mode and back
			- Goal tile should be tile along the paintables

		

		* Currently not possible to turn on spt, should it be possible? Decide.

		MAYBE:
		* Possible remove Next button after clearing level so player has to go to select screen?

		ISSUES:
		* Its possible to double click start level and create multiples

		// - Content -
		* Integrate pause menu with player inventory? Sounds like a good solution
		* Change Load Screen between scenes to animation or not?
		
		// - Mechanics Stuff -		
		
		// - Data stuff -
		* Clean Up tile definition and way levels are stored when created at runtime
		* Make system to store what level player completed and use that to update select level page
		* Make player gain gold and tiles when completing levels
		
		// - UI stuff -
		* Make main menu usable by keyboard
		* Make cleared levels show differently in the level select.
		* Add Start level popup if unlock is needed, show cost, show inventory at the same time? Maybe show this in level select instead. 
			- Selected menu shows up with more info in a info box under the selection grid

		// - LevelCreation Stuff -
		* Create randomized level creation for Bronze,Silver,Gold versions
		* Create all levels for main levels

		* BUGS, CRASHES, SLOW PERFORMANCE

		* NOT ENGAGING WITH COMMUNITY
		* CONFIGURABLE CONTROLS, 
		* TEXT TO SMALL,
