		BUGS
		* player sometimes on mobile keeps running after moving to a tile, why?
		* Issue with goal targets clipping, not always showing, prob has something to do with the rendering. 
		* Shallows in water show up in scene but not in game view (not possible to show shallows in mobile build?)
		* Animation moves player forward slightly. Does not really matter at runtime since its always animating, but in scene mode the position is not correct why?
		* Make sure unlimited tiers can be added without issues
		
		BEFORE PLAYTEST
		* Check that ingame menu is positioned correctly on build
		* Fix achievements 

		BEFORE RELEASE
		* Add more interfaces/namespaces where needed
		* Have a Support/Rate link button in the settings page? Somewhere have a text stating that the game exists on steam for pc as well?
		* Need Asset Bundle or Adressables??
		* Add Statistics / retention / dashboard / Unitys ?
		* Handle errors in data saving so players dont lose progress.
		* Polish
			* UI response improvements
				* Touch on menu make sparkles etc?
				* Selecting level in level select, buff the touched button and make fancier load of info into infoscreen
			* AssetKits UI particle Image asset might be useful for effects
		
		SOUND
		* Rework of sounds, decide what to use rework needed
		* Make Sound clips used OGG files to lower size and maybe compress quality?
		* Need better pick up and place sound combo. Remove or change step sound its terrible.
		* Sound Effects are lagging for some reason
				
		CONSIDER CHANGES:
		* Should boosts be available from within a game played? Giving player chance to boost before completing a started level? No?
		* Coins update from level complete is instant, maybe have them come after interstitial ad? Maybe have greater delay before ad so player have time to see this added coins?
		* Steps and Moves is bad names, it does not make it clear what it means change?
		* Student Hat is a good icon for missions page, but mission might be bad wording, find better name?
		* Have load ad button always available on boost panel so player can keep boosting even after a boost, maybe have a cap of 24h as boost?
		* Maybe have One pause screen where restart/continue/settings/Abandon buttons are located. How about Camera/input? Maybe not makes it strange when returning from settings?
		
		NEW MECHANICS:
		* Must have tutorial
			* Thinking of having tutorial levels with popup test/picktures/videos to show what to do.
		* Have coin sound until coins are filled up to total?
		* Maybe have honor system points that players can gather and compare to a highscore. When players have done all normal levels they can do the random into infinity
		* Include achievements in save / make internal Achievement system
		* Make an option is settings to preload ads, implement this

		NEW CONTENT
		* Have tile Variations player can use
		* Add irregular tiles? And have as separate Level Variant
		* In water add fishes jumping etc

		ACHIEVEMENTS IDEAS (Decide if achievements are good to have in game?)
			* Add rewarded ads counter for an achievement
			* Clearing all A,B,C levels
			* Clearing every level
			* Clearing Every level on par moves?!?
			* Boosting 10 times, 100 times etc
			* Playing every day for a week? Streak count?
			* Showing X rewarded ads

		ADS:
		* Maybe have ad-boosts stack up to a maximum.
		* Maybe always have banner on bottom showing? -YES
		* Maybe have Icon pop-up during play for ad-reward?
		* Implementation needs more work
			* Does it need consent to preload?
			* Better way to load the ads than current system?
			* +25% rewards for next 9 min (stackable?)
			* Maybe have watch ad available without playing?
			* Every 5 or 10 ad watches gives a guaranteed tile? (Maybe special tile for special Ad-related levels?!?)
		* Paid player get free gold every 5 min without watching ad.
		* Make separate game loop for paying player / Have a payable version on steam?

		IAP:
		* Create the IAP page? Maybe not to much work?
		* Maybe have gems as currency? Maybe implement later, not now.
		* Have skins that player can buy and use as player?
		* Make Shop Screen
		* Have game features unlocked by gold in shop
		* Check if IAP is the way to go, better revenue than ads Prob a good solution to have as well
		* Have some free coins that spawns now and then in the IAP Store page to draw players there

		MAYBE - IDEAS:
		* Have a ads description page that states why ads are in the game and how it works? (part of credits/rename to About?)
		* Have timer show on HUD? prob not, to stressy.(maybe have as option to turn on in settings/ unlockable in shop?)
		* Currently not possible to turn on spot, should it be possible? Decide. No...
		* Maybe have collectables that are tiles that form a collection that can be used to clear a set of special levels,
			but the player has to decide which tiles to bring into the levels themself. Many levels can be cleared with different set of tiles
			but With right combination all levels can be cleared if tiles are selected in a clever way.
		
		BUGS:
		* Exiting android app wont close the app only minimize it?

		GRAPHICS:
		* Figure out theme and color scheme that fits the game
		* Have different biomes for different difficult levels
			* Water added for "normal" biom
			* Add Snow, Lava, Clouds, Space, Aztec, Underground? Use separate Music/Sounds?
			* Have space background for space level tier
		
		RESOLUTION:
		* Make mobile detect what size the on screen touch inputs should be to fit the player
		* Make sure game scales correctly for different mobile resolutions
			* Resolution makes bottom part of game get outside of screen
		* Older phone does not grant rewards from ads nor save/load game data on file, why?
		
		TUTORIAL: (Fill in stuff that needs to be thaught)
		* Tutorial resolution is to low fix somehow
			* Show that sometimes there are more tile parts than goals, just need to fill them

		DATA STUFF:
		* Calibrate tile cost for level unlock as well as rewarded tiles.
		* Clean Up tile definition and way levels are stored when created at runtime
		* Have stored data Encrypyted?
		
		UI STUFF:
		* Change Load Screen between scenes to animation or not? Current solution, made it faster blackscreen 0.1 seconds.
		* Change selected color from dark red to something else? Clean Up selections permanently.
		* Make level select tabs more fancy?	
		* Fix aligning of text for level complete screen
		* Work on getting one predictable color scheme for UI
		* Have Selected button bump?
		* Recieving Tile Reward whould show more glimmering animation. Maybee also show coin gain?
		* Maybe have unclaimed rewards animate in info panel? Maybe not have rewards show here at all but show in the boost panel?
		
		LEVELCREATION STUFF:
		* Create randomized level creation for Bronze, Silver, Gold versions
		* Create all levels for main levels
		* Make solver to quickly check if solvable and fastest solve
