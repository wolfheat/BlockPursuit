DEVLOG FOR Block Pursuit"
Jun 2023

* IDEAS
- Make a box puzzle game for mobile.
- Possible game mode
	* Use set of pieces to cover a marked floor area to complete level
	* Randomized levels played to earn tiles, tiles can unlock main levels?

	* Have a window show earn 10gold free or watch ad get 100gold or random tile, activated behind a button which player can press.
	* After completing level show ad if more than 5min has passed?

		* Tiles can now be placed by shift click, preview is showned when shift is held, shows if placable
		* Tiles rotate by scroll wheel and piece type change by right click
3/7		* Made tile definition work so it can be saved into a scriptable object during runtime and loaded into game as level
4/7		* Levels are now selectable by WASD in levelselect and level starts with Space
		* ESC takes player to start menu from Level Select
		* Goals are now placable at levelcreator and saved to level definition
		* Goal tile should be tile along the paintables
5/7		* Created 15 easy levels 15 medium levels ad 5 hard levels, separated them into different lists

		* Tiers of levels now work in the level select, playe can change tier with the tabs.

12/7	* Adding coins and tiles after completing level.
		

		* Fix aligning of text for level complete screen

		* Add effect when gaining gold or tile, animated coins and tile adding up to total 
			in ingameUI until full before transitioning to result screen?

		ADS:
		* Add Ads screen and Icon. Icon shows every 5 min since last used.
			* X2  get X2 rewards for next hour by watching video
			* Take 10coins free or watch ad for +50gold ever 5 minute
			* OR Just watch ad for +50gold ever 5 minute
			* At reward screen have watch add to double coins button (this will make it optional)
			* Every 5 or 10 ad watches gives a guaranteed tile? (Maybe special tile for special levels?!?)





		* Implement Ads for gaining coins
		* Player can watch add ever 5 min to gain gold, but also whenever play the random levels to gain as well.
		* Paid player get free gold every 5 min without watching ad.

		MAYBE:
		* Have timer show on HUD? prob not, to stressy.(maybe have as option to turn on in settings/ unlockable in shop?)
		* IDEA -  Maybe have collectables that are tiles that form a collection that can be used to clear a set of special levels,
			but the player has to decide which tiles to bring into the levels themself. Many levels can be cleared with different set of tiles
			, but With right combination all levels can be cleared if tiles are selected in a clever way.
		
		RESOLUTION:
		* Make mobile detect what size the on screen touch inputs should be to fit the player
		* Issue with ingame menu not scaling correctly when changing res.
		* Change game to Landscape mode??
		* Strange issue which text on mobile not aligning correctly on resultscreen.
		* Issue with using landscape, disable or fix?
		* Make sure game scales correctly for different mobile resolutions

		ISSUES:

		// - BUGS -

		// - Content -
		* Make Shop Screen
		* Have some kind of tutorial?
		* Have game features unlocked by gold in shop
		* Change player to something else than a cube, character etc?
		* Show in tutorial the different input modes for touch
		* Figure out theme and color scheme that fits the game
		* Currently not possible to turn on spot, should it be possible? Decide.
		* Change Load Screen between scenes to animation or not?
